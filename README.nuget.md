# Spotflow.Cbor

A high-performance .NET library for serializing and deserializing CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data. Built on top of `System.Formats.Cbor`, this library provides a simple, type-safe API similar to `System.Text.Json` for working with CBOR data.

[See the Project Repository](https://github.com/spotflow-io/cbor-dotnet) for more information.
